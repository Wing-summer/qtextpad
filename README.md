# QTextPad
***A Lightweight Qt-based code and text editor***

QTextPad is designed to be a simple, lightweight text editor that works
seamlessly and simply across several desktop platforms.

It was created out of a desire to have a fast and light editor like the
excellent [Notepad2](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html), but with
support for other platforms like Linux and macOS, and for a much larger
range of file formats.  To that end, QTextPad uses the same Syntax
Highlighting library that powers [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/), giving
it access to the same (ever-growing) repository of file formats that Kate
supports.

## Features
* Supported on Windows, Linux, macOS
* Syntax highlighting support for hundreds of file types and dialects.
  * (Optional) online update of file type support, directly from
    Kate's repository.
* Support for reading and writing many common text encodings.
* Fast, lightweight design -- no plugins, session management, etc.
  to deal with when you just want to open a file.
* Attractive design with Light or Dark Theme.
* Many helpful code editing features inspired by other popular editors
  like Notepad2, Kate, gedit...
